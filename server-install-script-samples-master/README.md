The Tableau Server installer is intended for interactive installation and configuration of Tableau server. This approach works well for many users and administrators, but limits the ability to perform automated deployments using tools like Chef or Puppet.

This repository provides some reference implementations to show users and organizations how they can automate deployment of Tableau Server on Windows and Linux, using scripts to prepare the installation and run the installer executable with appropriate command-line arguments.

The [windows](windows/) subdirectory contains files related to automating installation for Tableau Server on Windows.

The [linux](linux/) subdirectory contains files related to automating installation for Tableau Server on Linux.
